* It is time to write your first test using the `unittest` library. Create a `pacman_tests.py` file and write your first set of tests.

* Go beyond the tests I wrote. What else would you test to make sure things work? Can you think of _boundary tests_ or _corner case scenarios_ that we may want to exercise?
