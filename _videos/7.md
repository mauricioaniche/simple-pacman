* Implement the `play()` and the `next_position` functions. If you want to try Pycharm's refactoring options, do like me: code everything in the `play()` method, and then, call the _Extract Method_ refactoring.

* Write automated tests for the `next_position` function. I can see at least 5 tests: one for each direction, and one for a random key.
