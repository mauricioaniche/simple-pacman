* Get your IDE ready! If you want to use Pycharm like I do, just download it at [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

* Before starting to write any code, reflect with yourself:
	* How would you implement a Pac-Man game?
	* What are the most important features of a Pac-Man game to you?
	* How would you represent the map where the pac-man and ghosts and all the characters walk in?
