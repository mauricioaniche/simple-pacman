* Implement the illegal moves and the within borders check. 

* Write automated tests for the `within_borders` function. For this one, there are lots of test cases to think: one for each border of the map, for example. Also, remember that bugs often happen in corner cases! The pacman should be able to go to the left most position of the map (e.g., column "0") but not more than that!
