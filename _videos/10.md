* Implement the `total_pills()` function and plug it in the `play()` function. As always, write unit tests for the `total_pills()`. Two test cases should be enough: a map with pills, a map with zero pills.

* The `play()` function returns three booleans now... It is getting complicated. Can you see a way of simplifying that?
