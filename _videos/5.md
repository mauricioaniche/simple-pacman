* Implement the `move_pacman()` function. Feel free to go for a different implementation! As long as the goal of the function is the same (i.e., move the pacman from one coordinate to another), we should be fine! 

* Can you remove the redudancy that we have now in the test code? How can we avoid the `map` variable being copied so many times there?
