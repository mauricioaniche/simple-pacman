* Implement the new UI. As an exceptional case, feel free to copy the code from my sources as typing the ASCII art drawings might be too boring.


* Can you think of other things to improve in the UI? I sure can! For example, if you win the game, the program prints the message but does not update the map. Print the map again once the game is over.
